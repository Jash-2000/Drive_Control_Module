This file contains the Low voltage circuitary developed in order to aid the functionalities of the car. The PCB designing and routing files as well as the associated gerber files
are present here.

  * BSPD - Brake System Pausiblity Device - This Safety Critical Signal uses a pressure sensor and shuts down the car in case of hard braking. It is also integrated with the DCM
for the purpose of logitics and also cutting down the signal for torque as well.
  * IMD - Insulation Monitoring device - This device esures that 2 different lines of voltage have no leakage current.
